      <description>In the summer of 2021, 2 friends and I were resolving the &amp;ldquo;schooled&amp;rdquo; Hackthebox machine, which uses the 3.9 version of moodle.
This version allowed RCE from a malicious plugin, you only needed to be an administrator for that. Looking further, we found an article from moodle talking about the existence of a Stored XSS by the parameter &amp;ldquo;moodle net profile&amp;rdquo; in the profile in version 3.9.1.
As that parameter was not sanitized, it allowed a malicious user to inject javascript code, making a simple payload to steal the cookie (MoodleSession) of the visitor who accessed his profile.</description>
